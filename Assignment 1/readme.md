1. Implement a program(s) to list the first 100 fibonacci numbers preferably in C/C++ in the
following manner: (Total: 50 points)
a. Using recursion (10 points)
b. Using loop (10 points)
c. Using recursion and memoization (10 points)
d. Using loop and memoization (10 points)
Find the speedup of all the programs on your machine by keeping program (1) as the
baseline. (10 points) -
Tips: Measure the time taken by the program on the CPU using timespec.
2. Write a simple Matrix Multiplication program for a given NxN matrix in any of the two of
your preferred Languages from the following buckets, where N is iterated through the set
of values 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512. N can either be hardcoded or specified as input -
(similar to the program discussed in the Tutorial session). (Total: 100 points)
Bucket1: C, C++, Go
Bucket2: Python, Java.

Further, consider two cases (a) Elements of matrix are of data type Double and (b) Integer type
In each case, (i.e. Bucket 1 for (a) and (b) + Bucket 2 for (a) and( b))
a. Report the output of the ‘time’ describing the system and CPU times. (25 points)
b. Using the ‘language hooks’ evaluate the execution time for the meat portions of the
program and how much proportion is it w.r.t. total program execution time. (25 points)
c. Plot the (a) and (b) execution times for each of the iterations. And compare the
performance (System and Program execution times) of the program for given value of N
for the languages in both the buckets. –Illustrate your observations. (50 points)
